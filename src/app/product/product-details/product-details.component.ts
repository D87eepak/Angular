Most of these screw into some form of shield anchor. Some lightweight forms are not screwed, but rely on just the pull on the ring itself to expand the anchor.",

Steel fasteners are usually made of stainless steel, carbon steel, or alloy steel.",

        "Hot Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons.[1][2] Forging has been done by smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals",
